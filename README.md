  The dataset utilized for this analysis was sourced from historical temperature records compiled in the "Global Temp" Excel file. This dataset includes the following key fields:

•	**Date:** The date of observation, providing a temporal dimension to the dataset. It is formatted in YYYY-MM-DD, covering a range from the 19th century to the present.

•	**AverageTemperature:** This field records the average temperature for the given date and location, measured in degrees Celsius. It represents the central metric used for analysis.

•	**AverageTemperatureUncertainty:** This field indicates the uncertainty or margin of error associated with each temperature measurement, reflecting the data's accuracy.

•	**State:** The state or province where the temperature was recorded, allowing for regional analysis of temperature trends.

•	**Country:** The country of the measurement, enabling a broader, global analysis of temperature changes.

  This data was collected from numerous meteorological stations across the globe and subsequently standardized to provide a comprehensive view of global temperature trends. For the purposes of this analysis, we focus primarily on the "AverageTemperature" metric to observe long-term trends and patterns in global climate behavior.

## Interpreting Visualizations

**1. Global Temperature Time Series**

  A line graph depicting global average temperatures over time provides a visual representation of how temperatures have changed throughout the years. For all of the countries, it shows that their average temperature is increasing over time, clearly illustrating the phenomenon of global warming, where average temperatures increase gradually over time. Peaks or dips in the graph may correspond to significant climate events such as volcanic eruptions, El Niño years, or industrial growth periods, providing context to the variations in global temperatures.

  This visualization directly answers questions about historical temperature changes by highlighting the trajectory and rate of warming. It can help identify critical periods where temperature anomalies deviate sharply from historical norms and compare them with global averages. By revealing the accelerating pace of recent warming, the graph also emphasizes the urgency for climate action and allows for correlation with other climate phenomena, such as extreme weather events or regional impacts, underscoring the broad implications of rising temperatures globally.

**2. Heat Map of Global Temperature Over Time**

  ![image](https://github.com/ColeSchilling/mgt4250spring2024/assets/168783532/14680487-91f9-4296-abc7-f4a016122f6f)

  A heat map of global temperatures over time visually represents temperature changes across different geographic regions, using color gradients to depict variations. For this visualization, the hotter the average temperature is for that year, the darker the blue. On the contrary, a country with a colder temperature will be filled with an orangish color. By puting the average temperatures for each country on a map and then being able to view the average temperature across different years, we can discover patterns that may allow us to create a plan to slow down or even resolve global warming. We can also observe these patterns to identify geographic "hotspots" of rapid warming.

  This visualization contributes to answering the question of how global average temperatures have changed by providing a spatial perspective, illustrating how warming is not uniform across the world. It highlights regions that are especially vulnerable to climate change, helping policymakers focus resources on regions facing the most severe impacts, such as rising sea levels or shifting agricultural zones. By distinguishing regions with differing trends, the heat map also reveals the influence of factors like geography, local climate policies, and industrial activities, enabling a more nuanced understanding of global climate dynamics and their regional variations.

**3. Global Temperature Tree Map**

  A global temperature tree map divides geographic regions into hierarchical rectangles based on temperature data. Each rectangle's size represents the proportionate impact or contribution of a region's temperature to the overall global trend, while the color reflects which country we are looking at. Looking at this visualization, we notice that Brazil and India contribute the most to the global trend of increasing temperature. They are closely followed by the United States, Australia, and China. We also notice that Russia and Canada have a very minimal effect on the global temperature, but they do still have an impact. 

  This tree map contributes to understanding global temperature changes by providing a comparative visual summary of regions experiencing the most significant changes. By organizing data into a hierarchical layout, it allows viewers to quickly grasp which regions contribute most to global warming trends. For instance, the map might reveal that specific regions and countries are particularly affected, helping researchers and policymakers prioritize mitigation and adaptation strategies. It also visually represents regional disparities in climate change impact, offering insights into why some areas are more vulnerable and emphasizing the importance of focused interventions tailored to regional characteristics. Lastly, it allows us to understand which countries we should look deeper into in order to find ways to resolve the issue of rising temperatures.

## Discussion & Summary

Below is an article that is related to the topic discussed above:

[Climate Change: Global Temperature](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature)

  The article "Climate Change: Global Temperature" by NOAA explains how global average temperatures have increased since the late 19th century, largely due to human activities such as fossil fuel combustion and deforestation. It provides data demonstrating that the past nine years have been the warmest in modern recordkeeping history, with 2023 ranking among the hottest years ever. The article highlights that while warming isn't uniform globally, it is occurring at an accelerating rate, with temperatures rising faster over land than the ocean due to thermal inertia. The article also explores future temperature projections, emphasizing the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to prevent severe temperature increases that could lead to catastrophic impacts on ecosystems, economies, and human health.

**AI responses to the questions: ChatGPT**

**1. How has the global average temperature changed over time?**

  The global average temperature has seen a significant rise over the past century. NOAA's Climate.gov reports that the temperature has increased by approximately 1.1°C since the late 19th century, with this trend accelerating in recent decades. Every month of 2023 ranked among the warmest ever recorded, and July through September 2023 were the first months to exceed 1.0°C above the long-term average​ (Climate.gov)​. NASA data also indicates that the past nine years have been the warmest in recorded history since modern data collection began in 1880​ (NASA Earth Observatory)​.

**2. Which regions or countries have experienced the most significant temperature changes, and how do these trends compare to global averages?**

  Certain regions have experienced temperature changes more acutely than others. The Arctic, for instance, has warmed two to three times faster than the global average due to feedback loops involving melting sea ice. Conversely, some regions, such as the Antarctic, have not experienced such pronounced warming due to differing climatic conditions​ (NASA Earth Observatory)​. Overall, land areas tend to warm faster than oceans due to the slower heat absorption and release of water. There are also regional disparities, with some areas cooling slightly or experiencing stable temperatures due to local factors like pollution levels that create temporary cooling effects​ (Climate.gov)​.

**3. Based on historical trends, what are the projected global and regional temperatures in the coming decades?**
  
  Projections show that if current greenhouse gas emissions trends continue, the global temperature could rise by at least 5°F (about 2.8°C) above the 1901-1960 average by the end of this century. In the worst-case scenario, temperatures could increase by as much as 10.2°F (about 5.7°C)​ (Climate.gov)​. NASA and the IPCC have released detailed projections indicating that future warming will vary depending on emissions pathways. High emissions could result in more than a 4°C rise by 2100, while successful mitigation efforts could limit warming to a few degrees​ (NASA)​​ (IPCC)​. These projections underline the urgency for significant action to reduce emissions to prevent severe and potentially catastrophic impacts.

**Do the visualizations align with the article and what ChatGPT said?**

  The visualizations, such as line graphs, heat maps, and tree maps, align well with the article and the generative AI responses because they effectively represent historical and projected global temperature trends. A line graph shows the consistent upward trend identified in the article, reflecting a temperature increase of 1.1°C since the late 19th century. Heat maps emphasize regional disparities, aligning with the article's assertion of regional variations​​. Heat maps highlight how recent years have been progressively warmer, supporting the notion that the past nine years have been the hottest on record​​. They also confirm the projections indicating that, depending on emissions pathways, global temperatures could rise by more than 5°F (2.8°C) by the end of the century​​. Together, these visualizations corroborate the narrative provided by both the article and generative AI responses regarding historical trends and future climate projections.
